# **Guidebook: Understanding Concurrent Writes and Version Vectors in Distributed Systems**

## **Introduction to Multi-Leader Replication and Concurrent Writes**

In distributed systems, replication plays a crucial role in ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Multi-leader replication, also known as multi-master replication, allows multiple nodes (leaders) to independently accept writes, which can lead to higher write throughput. However, this flexibility introduces a challenge: concurrent writes.

When two nodes update the same data independently at the same time, they create a situation known as **concurrent writes**. This guide will explore how to detect and handle such situations using version vectors, and various strategies to resolve conflicts.

## **Chapter 1: Multi-Leader Replication**

### **1.1 What is Multi-Leader Replication?**

Multi-leader replication allows multiple nodes (leaders) to handle write operations concurrently. Unlike single-leader replication, where all writes must go through one leader, multi-leader replication enables writes to occur across several nodes simultaneously. This increases the write throughput of the system and ensures higher availability.

However, the concurrent nature of writes introduces the problem of **write conflicts**. These conflicts arise when two nodes independently write different values to the same data, and then need to reconcile their changes.

### **1.2 The Problem of Concurrent Writes**

Consider two nodes (leaders) in a distributed counter system. Each leader maintains its own counter, and both nodes independently increment their respective counters. For instance:

* **Leader 1** increments its counter to 3.
* **Leader 2** increments its counter to 5.

When these counters are synchronized (i.e., the leaders send their updates to each other), a conflict arises:

* **Leader 1** sends the value `3` to **Leader 2**.
* **Leader 2** sends the value `5` to **Leader 1**.

At this point, we have a conflict because both leaders disagree on the value of the counter. The ideal result should be `8` (3 from Leader 1 + 5 from Leader 2). This situation highlights the need for mechanisms to detect and resolve concurrent writes.

## **Chapter 2: Version Vectors for Conflict Detection**

### **2.1 What is a Version Vector?**

A **version vector** is a data structure that tracks the number of increments each node (leader) has performed. Each leader maintains a vector with an entry for each other leader in the system. This allows the system to track the progress of each node's updates.

For example, imagine two leaders:

* **Leader 1** has performed 3 increments, and **Leader 2** has performed 5 increments.

  * The version vector for **Leader 1** is `[3, 0]`, indicating it has performed 3 increments and has seen 0 increments from Leader 2.
  * The version vector for **Leader 2** is `[0, 5]`, indicating it has performed 5 increments and has seen 0 increments from Leader 1.

When the nodes exchange their updates, they send both the counter value and their version vectors. This allows the system to determine whether the updates are concurrent or not.

### **2.2 Merging Version Vectors**

To resolve conflicts, the system must merge the version vectors from both leaders. Here's how:

1. **Combine the version vectors** by taking the maximum value from each index in the vector.
2. The **counter value** is the sum of the entries in the version vector.

For instance:

* **Leader 1** has a version vector of `[3, 0]` and counter `3`.
* **Leader 2** has a version vector of `[0, 5]` and counter `5`.

After synchronization:

* The merged version vector will be `[3, 5]`, and the total counter value will be `8` (3 from Leader 1 + 5 from Leader 2).

This method ensures that the system correctly handles concurrent writes by merging updates without losing any information.

### **2.3 Handling Further Updates**

When further updates occur, the version vectors help detect the overlap between the changes. For example, if **Leader 1** performs another increment, the version vector will become `[4, 5]`, and the counter will be `9`. When this update is sent to **Leader 2**, the system will merge the version vectors and counters, ensuring the total is correct.

### **2.4 How to Detect Concurrent Writes Using Version Vectors**

Version vectors allow the system to determine whether two writes are concurrent:

* If one version vector is **strictly greater than or equal to** another, it means the first write occurred **after** the second, and they are **not concurrent**.
* If the version vectors **cannot be strictly ordered** (i.e., there is no dominance between the two), the writes are **concurrent**.

#### Example:

* Version vector `A: [3, 5]`, `B: [5, 4]`.
* `A` is greater than or equal to `B` in the first index, but less in the second index. Thus, the writes are **concurrent**, meaning these changes were made independently and without knowledge of each other.

## **Chapter 3: Resolving Concurrent Writes**

### **3.1 Option 1: Storing Siblings**

When two concurrent writes are detected, one way to handle the conflict is to **store both writes** as siblings. This means the database will store both versions of the data and flag them as conflicting.

For instance, if two users write:

* User 1: "Jordan is scary" (version vector `[1, 0]`)
* User 2: "Jordan is cute" (version vector `[0, 1]`)

The system can store both values under the same key, like:

* Key: `Jordan`
* Value: `["scary", "cute"]`

When a user retrieves the value, they will see both options and be prompted to choose which one to keep. Once the user resolves the conflict, the system can delete the less preferred value and finalize the conflict resolution.

### **3.2 Option 2: Automatic Merging**

Alternatively, the system can automatically **merge** concurrent writes. This approach relies on **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**, which are data structures designed to automatically merge concurrent updates without requiring user intervention.

For example, a **counter** CRDT can automatically merge two concurrent updates by adding the values from both version vectors. This guarantees that the counter will reflect all increments, even if the updates were concurrent.

### **3.3 CRDTs: Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types**

CRDTs are specially designed data structures that can be safely updated concurrently across different replicas without causing conflicts. Some common CRDTs include:

* **Counters**: Merge increment operations by summing the values from each replica.
* **Sets**: Merge elements from each replica while ensuring no duplication.
* **Maps**: Merge key-value pairs by applying rules to handle concurrent changes.

The advantage of CRDTs is that they provide automatic conflict resolution at the data structure level, without needing external conflict resolution strategies.

## **Chapter 4: Advanced Topics**

### **4.1 Leaderless Replication**

Leaderless replication is a more advanced concept where there is no designated leader. Instead, any node can accept writes, and the system must rely on conflict detection and resolution techniques like version vectors and CRDTs to ensure consistency.

### **4.2 Handling Conflicts with External Systems**

In some cases, databases and distributed systems may rely on external conflict resolution mechanisms, such as user intervention or application-layer logic, to resolve conflicts more intelligently.

## **Conclusion**

Detecting and handling concurrent writes is essential in distributed systems, particularly in multi-leader replication setups. By using version vectors, systems can track and merge updates from multiple leaders, ensuring that the data remains consistent. Conflict resolution strategies, such as storing siblings or using CRDTs, provide different ways to handle concurrent writes and maintain data integrity.

By understanding these concepts, you can design and implement distributed systems that handle concurrent updates efficiently, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance while minimizing data conflicts.
