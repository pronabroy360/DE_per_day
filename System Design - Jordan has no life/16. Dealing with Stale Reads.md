# **Making Eventual Consistency Less Painful – A Practical Guide**

---

## **1. Introduction**

**Topic**: Eventual consistency
**Goal**: Understand the challenges it introduces and explore practical strategies to mitigate user-facing issues.

> Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems to improve performance and availability by allowing data to become consistent over time. However, this "eventual" behavior can lead to confusing or stale reads for users if not handled properly.

---

## **2. Why Eventual Consistency?**

**Problem with Strong Consistency**:

* High latency when writing to globally distributed databases.
* Every write must propagate to all replicas before acknowledging the client.
* In systems with replicas in the US, Europe, Australia, etc., waiting for global synchronization is often too costly.

**Solution**: Use **eventual consistency** to:

* Improve write speed and system availability.
* Let replicas sync asynchronously.

---

## **3. The Core Problem: Reading Stale Data**

When a user writes data and immediately reads it back, they may:

* **Not see their write** if the read goes to a lagging replica.
* **Think the write failed**, even though it succeeded.

---

## **4. Patterns & Strategies to Improve Eventual Consistency**

### **4.1. Reading Your Own Writes**

**Problem**:
A user makes a change (e.g., updates relationship status) and reads from a stale replica, seeing no change.

**Solutions**:

* **Sticky Reads**: After a write, read from the same node that processed the write for a short period (e.g., 10 seconds).
* **Timestamp Checking**:

  * Tag the write with a logical timestamp (e.g., time 100).
  * Before reading from a replica, check if it has processed updates >= time 100.
  * Read only if the replica has caught up.

> ⚠️ Note: Timestamps may not be 100% reliable in distributed systems due to clock skew, but they work well in most cases.

### **4.2. Monotonic Reads**

**Problem**:
A user reads newer data first, then older data due to switching between replicas. This feels like "going back in time."

**Example**:

1. Reads message #3: "I'm free today"
2. Next read shows message #2: "Let's hang out"
3. Next read shows message #1: "Hey guys"

**Solution**:

* **Replica Affinity (Sticky Sessions)**: Always read from the same replica during a session.
* **Replica Selection by Hashing**:

  * Use a deterministic mapping such as: `replica = userID % numberOfReplicas`.
  * Ensures consistency across reads unless the replica is down.

> ⚠️ Drawback: Reduced fault tolerance if the chosen replica is down.

### **4.3. Consistent Prefix Reads** *(Mentioned but not elaborated in transcript)*

**Problem**:
Reads might reflect partial updates where order matters, e.g., seeing message #1 and #3 but not #2.

**Ideal Strategy**:

* Ensure if a replica shows update #3, it must also show #1 and #2 (preserve causality).
* Often enforced through **consistency prefixes** or **causal consistency** techniques.

---

## **5. General Advice for Developers**

* Understand **your consistency needs**: Not all applications require strong consistency.
* Use **eventual consistency when performance and availability matter more** than instant correctness.
* Implement **user-facing hacks**:

  * Sticky reads
  * Replica pinning
  * Timestamp validation

---

## **6. Limitations & Considerations**

* These strategies don’t guarantee perfect consistency — only **practical improvements**.
* Real-world systems must also handle:

  * Replica failures
  * Network partitions
  * Complex synchronization logic
* Use distributed consensus algorithms (e.g., **Paxos**, **Raft**) or **CRDTs** for critical data.

---

## **7. Conclusion**

Eventual consistency is a trade-off — it enhances performance and scalability but can lead to confusing user experiences. By applying intelligent read strategies and understanding edge cases like reading your own writes and maintaining monotonic reads, developers can **"make eventual consistency less shit"** and create smoother, more predictable applications.
