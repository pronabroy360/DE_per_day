### Guide to **Read Committed Isolation** in Databases

#### **Introduction to Concurrency in Databases**
- Databases are multi-threaded, meaning multiple **reader** and **writer** threads can access and modify data concurrently.
- This introduces concurrency issues, such as race conditions, where the order of operations is not guaranteed. The outcome of operations can vary depending on how threads are scheduled.

#### **The Need for Isolation in Databases**
- With multiple threads acting on the same data, it becomes difficult to ensure correctness. For example, when a writer thread modifies data, there is no guarantee that a reader thread will see the data in a consistent state.

#### **Key Terminology**
1. **Commit**: A write operation is **committed** when it has been successfully completed and the changes are saved to the database.
   - If a transaction writes to two rows (e.g., row 1 and row 2), both writes are only committed when both operations are successful. If only one write succeeds, the changes are not fully committed.

#### **Types of Race Conditions**
- **Race conditions** occur when multiple threads operate concurrently on shared resources, causing unexpected or incorrect results. Two common types of race conditions are:

##### **1. Dirty Write**
- A **dirty write** happens when a transaction writes over data that is not yet committed by another transaction. This can result in inconsistent data in the database.
  
**Example Scenario**:
- Thread T1 tries to update the `bathwater.purchaser` to "Jordan", while Thread T2 tries to update the same field to "Donald Trump". If T2's write happens before T1's commit, and T1's write then overwrites T2's uncommitted data, this results in a dirty write.
- This causes an inconsistency because the database contains data from both transactions, neither of which was fully committed.

**Fixing Dirty Writes**:
- **Row-level locking**: A transaction can lock a row it is working on, preventing other transactions from modifying that same row until the current transaction commits. This ensures data integrity by preventing writes to uncommitted data.
- However, locking can cause performance issues, as it blocks other threads from accessing the data, which may lead to bottlenecks.

##### **2. Dirty Read**
- A **dirty read** occurs when a transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction. If that transaction fails or gets rolled back, the reading transaction will have inconsistent or invalid data.
  
**Example Scenario**:
- Transaction T1 subtracts $10 from a bank balance for a purchase (e.g., buying foot pictures). Transaction T2 reads the balance but the update from T1 is not yet committed.
- If T1's update is later rolled back (e.g., due to an issue with the payment), T2 has read an uncommitted, and now incorrect, value.

**Fixing Dirty Reads**:
- **Row-level locking** could prevent dirty reads, but as mentioned, locking can slow down the system due to bottlenecks.
- **Storing old values**: A more efficient method to handle dirty reads is by storing the old value until the commit. This way, even if a write operation fails, the previous value is retained until the transaction is committed, ensuring consistency for read operations.

#### **Read Committed Isolation**
- **Read Committed** isolation is a database isolation level that ensures the following:
  - It **prevents dirty reads**: A transaction can only read committed data, not data that is being written or is uncommitted.
  - It **prevents dirty writes**: A transaction will not overwrite data that has not been committed.

This isolation level guarantees that a transaction only sees data that has been fully committed by other transactions.

#### **Other Concurrency Issues**
- The above two issues (dirty reads and dirty writes) are just a subset of possible race conditions in databases.
- **More complex race conditions** exist and can be harder to detect. In future videos, more advanced concurrency issues and isolation levels will be discussed.

---

#### **Conclusion**
- **Read Committed Isolation** provides a simple yet effective way to handle basic concurrency issues such as dirty reads and dirty writes.
- While it prevents some common problems, it does not address all concurrency issues in databases, especially when more complex scenarios arise. 
- Future learning will involve deeper dives into more advanced isolation levels and solutions for handling complex race conditions.
