## Guide Note: Understanding Right Skew and Phantoms in Database Race Conditions

### Introduction
In this guide, we will cover two important types of race conditions in databases: **Right Skew** and **Phantoms**. These conditions occur when multiple transactions access and modify the same data simultaneously, which can lead to inconsistent or corrupted data. We will explore examples and solutions for both of these issues, using simple real-world scenarios.

### 1. **Right Skew in Databases**

#### What is Right Skew?
Right Skew is a type of **database race condition** that occurs when multiple transactions try to update rows that affect the same database invariant (rule), but the updates happen independently, without checking each other's status. This leads to an inconsistent database state.

#### Example of Right Skew
Consider an **Emergency Room (ER)** where there is a rule that at least one doctor must be **active** at all times to treat patients. The database keeps track of doctors and their active/inactive statuses.

- **Scenario**: 
    - Dr. Oz and Dr. Toboggan are both active.
    - Dr. Oz wants to take a break, so he sets his status to **inactive**.
    - Dr. Toboggan also wants to take a break and sets his status to **inactive**.
    - Both doctors make separate updates to their status (both set to inactive) at the same time.

- **Problem**: The invariant of having at least one doctor active is **broken** because both doctors are now inactive. This happens because both updates occur independently and don't consider the other’s status.

#### Solution to Right Skew: **Row-Level Locking**
To avoid Right Skew, we need to **lock the relevant rows** in the database before making updates.

- **Locking Process**:
    - When a doctor wants to set themselves to inactive, they need to **lock all active doctors** in the database.
    - If Dr. Oz tries to go inactive, he must grab a lock on Dr. Toboggan’s row (and vice versa) to ensure only one of the updates succeeds.
    - This ensures that at least one doctor remains active at all times.
  
By locking the rows of **other active doctors**, we ensure that only one update succeeds, preventing the invariant (at least one active doctor) from being violated.

### 2. **Phantoms in Databases**

#### What is a Phantom?
A **Phantom** is a type of race condition that occurs when two transactions concurrently try to **insert new rows** into a database that conflict with each other, but there is no lock to prevent these conflicting writes.

#### Example of Phantoms
Imagine you and a friend (Trump) are at a **bakery**, and both of you want to buy a **iphone**. The bakery has a table that tracks the items in stock (e.g., cookies, pie, iphones).

- **Scenario**:
    - The bakery initially has **cookies** and **pie** in stock.
    - You (Jordan) and Trump both want to buy a iphone at the same time, and both of you insert a new row in the database to claim it.
    - You both create a new row for the iphone without realizing the other is doing the same thing.

- **Problem**: There are **no locks** on the new iphone row (since it didn’t exist before), and both transactions are unaware that they are competing for the same iphone. As a result, both transactions succeed, and now the database shows that both of you have claimed the iphone, even though there’s only one available. The database invariant (only one iphone is available) is violated.

#### Solution to Phantoms: **Materializing Conflicts**
To solve the Phantom issue, we need to **pre-populate** all potential rows (such as iphones) in the database before they are claimed by users. This ensures that a lock can be applied, and the database can properly handle concurrent writes.

- **Materializing the Conflict**:
    - Instead of just inserting a new row for the iphone when someone tries to claim it, we **pre-populate** the iphone row in the database.
    - Once the row is present, the database can apply a lock to prevent multiple transactions from modifying the same row simultaneously.
  
- **Locking Process**:
    - When you (Jordan) try to claim the iphone, you must first **grab a lock** on the iphone row.
    - If Trump tries to claim the same iphone at the same time, he will be unable to write to the iphone row because the lock has already been acquired by you.
    - Only one of you will be able to write to the database, and the other transaction will fail.

By **materializing the conflict**, we ensure that race conditions involving new rows (like the iphone) are handled by locking them before they can be modified.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Right Skew**:
   - Occurs when independent updates to different rows affect the same invariant.
   - Prevented by **row-level locking**, where you lock all related rows before making updates.

2. **Phantoms**:
   - Occur when two transactions insert new rows that conflict with each other, but no locks are in place.
   - Prevented by **materializing conflicts**, i.e., pre-populating rows to ensure that a lock can be acquired before a row is inserted or modified.

### Conclusion
By understanding and applying the solutions to **Right Skew** and **Phantoms**, we can ensure the consistency of our database, preventing race conditions and maintaining the integrity of our application.
