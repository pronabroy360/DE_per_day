# 🧠 Column-Oriented Storage: Explained

## 🎬 Introduction
The speaker introduces the topic with a casual tone and announces a deep-dive into **column-oriented storage** — a method of storing data that’s crucial for analytics and performance in databases, especially in data-intensive applications.

---

## 📦 Row-Oriented Storage (Traditional)
**Definition**: Stores each entire row of a table contiguously on disk.

### 🧱 Structure:
- Data is stored like an array of rows.
- Each file chunk contains full rows.
- E.g., one file might store rows 1–100, another rows 101–200.

### ✅ Advantages:
- Efficient for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) applications like web apps.
- If you're accessing complete user profiles (one row at a time), this is ideal.

## 📊 Column-Oriented Storage
**Definition**: Stores each column's values contiguously on disk.

### 🧱 Structure:
- All values from a single column are stored together.
- E.g., all "name" values in one file, all "email" values in another.

### ✅ Advantages:
- Great for **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**.
- Ideal when performing operations across a column (e.g., average salary, max age).

## 🔍 Performance Benefits
- **Disk I/O optimization**: Hard drives work faster when reading adjacent data.
- In columnar format, values needed for column-wise operations are stored together, reducing read time.
- **Cache efficiency**: More relevant data fits in memory or CPU cache.

## 🧱 Compression in Column-Oriented Storage

### 1. **Bitmap Encoding**
- Converts values into binary form — `1` where value matches a condition, `0` otherwise.
- Example:
  - For value = 1 → `[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`

### 2. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**
- Encodes sequences of identical bits.
- From the bitmap above: `2 zeros, 2 ones, 2 zeros` → `2-2-2`

### 3. **Dictionary Encoding**
- Replace repeated strings with numeric codes.
- E.g., `Liv`, `Marquee`, `Leben` become `000`, `001`, `010`, etc.
- 5 unique clubs = 3 bits needed (2³ = 8 combinations).

### 🎯 Compression Benefits:
- **Reduces size on disk**
- **Faster queries** (less to load and process)
- **More data fits into memory/cache**

## 📥 Real-Life Use Case: Facebook
- **Row-Oriented**: Loading full user profiles.
- **Column-Oriented**: Data scientists calculating average logins, rejections, etc.

## 🔄 Predicate Pushdown
- A feature (commonly used in **Apache Parquet**) that enhances performance.
- Allows the database engine to **filter out unnecessary data early**.
- Example: When querying only rows where `age > 30`, only relevant column chunks are read.

## 📌 Summary
| Feature | Row-Oriented | Column-Oriented |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Best for | OLTP (Web apps) | OLAP (Analytics) |
| Storage | Row-wise | Column-wise |
| Compression | Less effective | Highly efficient |
| Query Speed | Slower for analytics | Faster for column operations |
| Formats | CSV, JSON, traditional DBs | Parquet, ORC, etc. |
