This video dives deep into **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**, explaining their importance and application in distributed systems. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

### 1. **CRDTs Introduction**

* **Context:** In a distributed multi-leader setup, write conflicts can occur when multiple leaders try to update the same data. The goal is to handle these conflicts gracefully.
* **Approaches to Conflict Resolution:**

  * **Last Write Wins (LWW):** Can be unreliable because of clock synchronization issues in distributed systems.
  * **Storing Siblings:** A version vector helps track concurrent writes. Both versions are kept and can be merged later.
  * **CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types):** Automatically resolve conflicts in a way that guarantees eventual consistency.

### 2. **Example: Shopping List**

* **Conflict Scenario:** Two leaders are updating a shopping list, one adding items like ham and eggs, and the other adding milk and cookies. The goal is to have both leaders eventually agree on the full list (ham, eggs, milk, cookies).

### 3. **CRDT Implementations:**

* **Operational CRDT:** Instead of sending the full state of the data (e.g., a counter), only operations (e.g., "increment") are sent between nodes. The key advantage is the reduced amount of data transmitted, which is **O(1)** in terms of network space.
* **State-based CRDT:** Entire states are exchanged between nodes (e.g., a full counter state like `5, 4`). The state is merged using a merge function, which ensures consistency even if nodes receive updates in different orders.

**State-based CRDTs** require:

* **Commutativity:** The order of operations doesn't matter.
* **Associativity:** The groupings of operations don't affect the result.
* **Idempotence:** Reapplying the same update multiple times doesn't change the result.

### 4. **Gossip Protocol for Propagation:**

* **Gossip Protocol:** A method for disseminating updates across nodes. Each node "infects" others by passing updates, ensuring that eventually, all nodes converge on the same state.
* **Advantages:** Eventually, the system becomes consistent across all nodes, even if some nodes receive updates out of order or multiple times.

### 5. **Types of Data Structures in CRDTs:**

* **Distributed Counter:** A simple counter with increments from different nodes. The state of the counter is represented by a vector of increments from each leader.
* **Decreasable Counter:** Similar to a distributed counter but allows both increments and decrements. Each node tracks both and calculates the total as the sum of increments minus decrements.
* **Sets:** A set can be represented using two lists: added and removed items. The union of these lists gives the final set, and the merge operation ensures conflict-free updates.

### 6. **Advanced Set Handling:**

* To handle cases where an item is removed but might later be re-added, a **unique tag** can be assigned to each addition, allowing re-addition even if an item has been removed.

### 7. **Sequence CRDTs (Teaser):**

* Managing a list in a conflict-free way is challenging because it requires ordering. Sequence CRDTs handle this ordering problem and ensure that the list remains consistent across all nodes.

### Conclusion

CRDTs offer a way to handle distributed data in systems with multiple leaders and concurrent writes. They are a powerful tool for ensuring **eventual consistency** without requiring complex conflict resolution mechanisms. The video also hints at upcoming topics like sequence CRDTs, which could be vital for ordering-sensitive use cases.

This should give you a good foundation to understand how CRDTs are applied in real-world distributed systems!
