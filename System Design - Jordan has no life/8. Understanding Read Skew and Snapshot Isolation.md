### Guide: Understanding Read Skew and Snapshot Isolation in Databases

This guide will walk you through the key concepts introduced in the transcript, focusing on **Read Skew** (also called **Repeatable Read**) and **Snapshot Isolation** in databases, using a detailed example for clarity. These concepts are important when dealing with concurrent database transactions to ensure consistency and prevent issues like race conditions. Let’s break down the details.

### 1. **What is Read Skew (Repeatable Read)?**

**Read Skew**, or **Repeatable Read**, is a type of **race condition** that occurs when a database read operation retrieves inconsistent data due to an intervening write operation.

#### Example Scenario:

In the example, the table represents the **bank accounts** of the Kardashian family, with each person's balance. The database has an invariant that the total balance across all accounts is **$1 million**, and the transactions can only modify the balances by transferring money between the accounts.

- Initially, you are reading the balances of the accounts, starting with **Caitlyn's** balance.
- During the read process, **Caitlyn** decides to transfer **$100K** from her account to **Chris**, updating her balance to **$200K** and reducing **Chris's** balance to **$0**.
  
However, because the read operation is done sequentially, by the time you finish reading all other accounts and get to **Chris's account**, the new balance (after the transaction) is not visible to your read, even though the transfer has happened. This means your read might show an inconsistent view of the database where the total balance does not add up to **$1 million**.

#### The Issue:
- You perform a **long read** and during that time, a **write operation** happens (Caitlyn’s transfer).
- Since **reads do not block writes**, your **inconsistent snapshot** might miss the changes from the write, causing an incorrect **total balance** (read skew).
  
The database has **read consistency issues** because parts of the data you read might not be up-to-date.

### 2. **Understanding the Write-Ahead Log (WAL)**

A **Write-Ahead Log** (WAL) is used by databases to ensure **durability** and **atomicity** of transactions. This log stores all write operations before they are actually written to the main database, which ensures that if the system crashes, you can replay the transactions from the WAL to restore consistency.

The WAL provides an **ordering** of transactions and assigns a **monotonically increasing sequence number** to each write. This sequence number can be used to track and reconstruct the state of the database at any given point in time.

### 3. **How to Fix Read Skew Using Snapshot Isolation**

To address read skew, **Snapshot Isolation** is a technique that ensures consistent views of the database, even during long-running transactions.

#### Key Steps for Implementing Snapshot Isolation:

1. **Track Transaction Numbers (Timestamps):**
   - Every write operation gets a **timestamp** (or sequence number) that represents when it was executed.
   - This ensures that writes are ordered in the database.

2. **Store Old Values with Transaction Numbers:**
   - Rather than overwriting the old values, you store all the previous values with the transaction number that wrote them.
   - This means you don’t have to maintain a completely new row for every transaction but rather just track the changes made to the data.

3. **Create a Consistent Snapshot:**
   - When you need to get a consistent view of the data at a specific point in time (say **T15**), you can use the **transaction timestamps** to filter out any changes that occurred **after** that time.
   - For example, if you want to see the state of the database at **T15**, you will:
     - Ignore all writes that occurred after **T15**.
     - For each row, you take the most recent value written **before** **T15**.

#### Example:
Let’s see how this works with the Kardashian family table:

- For **Caitlyn**, the most recent value **before T15** is from **transaction T12**, where her balance was **$200K**.
- For **Kendall**, the write operation at **T15** is the latest, so her balance is the one recorded at **T15**.
- For **Chris**, if no write occurred before **T15**, there would be no row for Chris before **T15**.
  
By maintaining a history of changes with transaction timestamps, you can always ensure you are reading a consistent state of the database, even if other transactions are concurrently writing data.

### 4. **Snapshot Isolation in Action**

- The key idea of **Snapshot Isolation** is to provide each transaction with a **snapshot** of the database at the time it starts. This way, even if other transactions modify the data during the read, the transaction will only see the data as it was when the transaction began.
  
#### Benefits of Snapshot Isolation:
- **Consistency**: Ensures that long-running reads are consistent and not affected by concurrent writes.
- **Concurrency**: Allows more transactions to run concurrently because it avoids the need for locks between reads and writes.
- **Performance**: It can improve performance by reducing lock contention, especially in read-heavy applications.

### 5. **Closing Thoughts**

This explanation provided an overview of **Read Skew**, **Write-Ahead Logs**, and how to handle these issues using **Snapshot Isolation**. By implementing snapshot isolation, you can ensure that your long-running database transactions get consistent and accurate views of the data, even in the face of concurrent updates.

In summary, **Snapshot Isolation** is a powerful tool for handling race conditions and maintaining consistency in databases. By leveraging the write-ahead log and transaction timestamps, databases can provide a consistent view of the data without blocking reads and writes from different transactions.

If you're developing systems that require high concurrency, understanding and implementing snapshot isolation can significantly improve data consistency and performance.
